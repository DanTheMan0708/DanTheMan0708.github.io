Hi there everybody. Welcome to my first official blog post. 
Today I want to talk more about the game Fortnite and why I like the game.

Fortnite is a very fun and competitive game. It is one of the most popular games. It has a wide range of stuff to do like:
-learning how to build
-learning how to edit
-learnig how to **FULL PIECE** somebody
-and playing a wide range of maps like Battle Royal, Reload, OG Chapter 1 and even creative maps 
-there is even a ranked made of most games by Epic(gets very hard as you progress)

For me it was very fun learning all of these stuff and also challenging. I still to this day warm up and creative maps before I start playing Ranked Reaload.

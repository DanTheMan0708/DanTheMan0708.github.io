Hi there, everybody! Welcome to my first official blog post.
Today, I want to talk more about the game Fortnite and why I like it.

Fortnite is a very fun and competitive game. Itâ€™s one of the most popular games, and it has a wide range of things to do, such as:

- Learning how to build  
- Learning how to edit  
- Learning how to FULL PIECE somebody  
- Playing a variety of maps like Battle Royale, Reload, OG Chapter 1, and even creative maps  
- There's even a ranked mode that Epic Games made, which gets harder as you progress    

For me, it was very fun and challenging to learn all these things. I still warm up in creative maps before I start playing Ranked Reload. Reload is my favorite gamemode because when you die and are playing solos, you don't have to wait too long to queue for the next matchâ€”you can instantly respawn and do that twice before having to queue again. I can play this gamemode for a pretty long time without getting bored. If I get bored, Iâ€™ll probably switch to watching a series, movie, or just start playing Minecraft. I wonâ€™t play Roblox, thoughâ€”I may be a Fortnite and Minecraft player, but no, I am not a Robloxer. ðŸ˜Ž

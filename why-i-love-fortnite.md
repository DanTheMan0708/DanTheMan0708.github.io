  Hi there everybody. Welcome to my first official blog post. 
  Today I want to talk more about the game Fortnite and why I like the game.

  Fortnite is a very fun and competitive game. It is one of the most popular games. It has a wide range of stuff to do like:  
  
  -learning how to build  
  -learning how to edit  
  -learnig how to **FULL PIECE** somebody  
  -and playing a wide range of maps like Battle Royal, Reload, OG Chapter 1 and even creative maps   
  -there is even a ranked made of most games by Epic(gets very hard as you progress)  

  For me it was very fun learning all of these stuff and also challenging. I still to this day warm up and creative maps before I start playing Ranked Reaload.
  Reload is my favorite gamemode, because when you die and are playing solos you don't have to wait that long que to vind the next match you can instantly respwan and do that 2 times before haviing to que again. I can play this gamemode for a pritty long time without getting bored. If I get bored I will proparbly swicth to watching a serier, movie or just start playing Minecraftl I will not play Roblox, because I might be a Fortniter and Minecrafter but no i am not the Robloxer.
